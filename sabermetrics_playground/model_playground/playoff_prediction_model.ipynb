    "This notebook walks through the process of attempting to build as advanced an MLB playoff predictive model as possible using only team statistics. Though this approach is likely inferior to a more sophisticated model built on the microfoundations of individual player data, it will hopefully both serve as a strong baseline model to compare future models to and be a nice way to practice iterating on a very simple baseline playoff model to add complexity and hopefully improve model performance.

For example, in the 2021 playoff format, since the Braves avoided the Wild Card round, their array would be represented as [Lost in NLDS, Lost in NLCS, Lost in WS, Won WS] = [0,0,0,1]. The projected outcomes array is in the same format as the actual outcomes array, but gives the percentage of time a team ended up with the placement corresponding to the array index as an input for each index. For example, the Braves' 2021 projected outcomes array might have looked something like [45, 22, 9, 4]. \n",
